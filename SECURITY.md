## Reporting a Vulnerability
If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please report it privately.

Preferred channels:

- Email: send details to `nshimamura@parentyai.com`

Please include:
- Affected endpoint / file / commit SHA (if known)
- Steps to reproduce (PoC)
- Impact and suggested fix (if you have one)

## Supported Versions
Only the default branch (`main`) is supported. Security fixes are shipped via PR and deployed through CI.

## Disclosure
We will acknowledge receipt, investigate, and coordinate a fix and disclosure timeline where appropriate.
