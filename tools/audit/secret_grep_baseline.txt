# Lightweight secret-grep baseline (observability only).
#
# Source of truth for secret scanning is gitleaks in CI.
# This file exists so humans can quickly see what patterns are in-scope.
#
# Notes:
# - Keep false positives low; do not include generic words like "secret".
# - This baseline should NOT contain real secrets.
